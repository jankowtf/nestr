Description: The package provides an extendable interface to conveniently
    create nested object structures based on using environments. Object
    values can be set and retrieved based on path-like names/identifiers
    (e.g. `output/print/type = "pdf"` will be translated into the
    following nested environment structure: `output$print$type` with the
    value being`"pdf"`). Also, it allows to specify reactive nested object
    structures, i.e. objects that are dynamically linked to other objects
    and thus automatically stay synced. Furthermore, the package provides
    means to transform nested environment structures to nested lists and
    JSON objects.
